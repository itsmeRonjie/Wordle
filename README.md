# Wordle

This is an implementation of the popular word-guessing game, Wordle.

## Features

*   Guess the word of the day.
*   Receive feedback on your guesses (correct letter in the correct position, correct letter in the wrong position, incorrect letter).
*   Track your statistics (wins, losses, streak).
*   (Add any other specific features your version has)

## Installation

(Provide instructions on how to clone the repository, build the project, and run it. This will depend on the technology stack you are using.)

## How to Play

The goal of Wordle is to guess the five-letter word of the day in six tries or less. After each guess, the tiles will change color to show how close your guess was to the word:

*   **Green:** The letter is in the word and in the correct spot.
*   **Yellow:** The letter is in the word but in the wrong spot.
*   **Red:** The letter is not in the word.
